# ⛑️ Rescue scripts for Linux

## 📶 Very slow WiFi
Problem with some Intel wifi adapters.  
Hotfix is to disable 802.11n. But don't consider this as permanent fix.  
Script is [here][1].  
Tested and worked on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS with Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165.
Another solution: upgrade kernel. I had upgraded kernel to 4.19 and WiFi got back to normal.
